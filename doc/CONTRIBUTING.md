# Coding Guide

Contributors should aim to produce robust, maintainable software that is
enjoyable to work with. In service of this goal, consider the following
guidelines:

1. Choose simple solutions over clever ones.

2. Choose readability over a smaller line count.

3. Choose short names that convey meaning in context.

4. Imitate the coding style in the file you're working on, and use your
judgment.

5. Specification comments are helpful in headers, but should be a last resort
in implementation (see points 1 and 2).

6. Please be courteous to maintainers by making changes as small as necessary,
and by maintaining a clean and linear commit history.

Look to the `pshm` library to illustrate (however imperfectly) how I am
applying these principles.

# Code of Conduct

Building software should be enjoyable and fun for *all* involved. Make it so ðŸ––.
