// write lock or with no sql lock at all (but not with read lock taken). It is
// advised to call the function under the lock that made the changes, for
// reliability (and because recursive locks are almost free in the current
// implementation).
// All of the functions are designed to be very fast, with complexity
// proportional (only) to the path/folder depth (that is number of folders
// between the root and the folder, not number of sub folders) with additional
// cache to skip sql queries.

// Init does not allocate anything at this point and can be used as re-init
