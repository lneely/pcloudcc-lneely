# Introduction

`pcloudcc` is simple linux console client for pCloud cloud storage derived from the console-client developed by pCloud. This version is independently maintained by me, whose only affiliation with pCloud is as a user of their services. Due credit goes to Anton Titov, Ivan Stoev, and pCloud.

# Supported Platforms & Distributions

The target operating system and platform for this program is `linux/amd64`, and has been reported to work on `linux/aarch64`. Program behavior on 32-bit architectures is [considered undefined](https://github.com/lneely/pcloudcc-lneely/issues/85).

I aim to support as many distributions as possible. I maintain a package for [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pcloudcc-lneely) and [Nix](https://github.com/lneely/nixpkgs). I do not plan on providing or maintaining any other packages, but encourage anyone interested in doing so for their own distributions.

# Notices

## Security Notice

My code audits are best-effort, and I make security enhancements as I identify problems. However, I *do not* promise that this program is free of even older and well-known security vulnerabilities. Therefore, I recommend using this program only on a *trusted single-user* system. **Security-related code audits and contributions are most welcome!**

## Pending Transfers

Stopping the daemon will break pending background transfers!
`pcloudcc` does not currently provide a command to check for pending
transfers. You can currently check this by ensuring there is only one
file named `cached` in `~/.pcloud/Cache`. Usually this is a large
file.
